<h2 align="center">Getting Started</h2>

### Requirements 

To get started first you should either clone or download the repository.

You should also have node.js and yarn installed on your computer.

To download the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) just click on the link, usually yarn is installed along with node.js.


### Installing

The first step you must follow to run the project is to install all its dependencies.

The following commands should do this for you.

```
yarn install
```

### Starting with Webpack
```
yarn run dev (development environment)
yarn run build (production environment)  
```

## Usage

### Introduction 

This webpack was basically made to supply the need of multiple entries like sass and pug, and generate in separate files.

### BrowserSync
  This webpack has BrowserSync it performs auto reloading after any changes to the file without the need for any software such as `Fiddler` to make this change in the production / development environment. 
 ```js
 new BrowserSyncPlugin({
      open: 'external',
      https: true,
      ui: false,
      host: `${storeName}.vtexlocal.com.br`,
      startpath: '/admin/login/',
      proxy: `https://${storeName}.vtexcommercestable.com.br`,
      serveStatic: [
        {
          route: '/arquivos',
          dir: [vtex],
        },
      ],
    }), 
  ```

  open `webpack.config.js` inside him have two variables:


  This variable is for you to put the name of your store.
  ```js
    const storeName = '{{your store name}}'
  ```

  The second variable is for the current folder where the files are generated by default the webpack is configured to compile everything in / dist;

  ```js
    const vtex = '/dist'
  ```
This variabel is responsible for making the exchange of files from your machine to `https://{{yourstore}}.vtexcommercestable.com.br/arquivos/` from vtex. Remembering that the files must have the same name.

After you have done the basic configuration for BrowserSync to work

**Starting development environment**

  `yarn run dev`

If everything is ok the terminal will show this message:

```js
[Browsersync] Proxying: https://{{yourStore}}.vtexcommercestable.com.br
[Browsersync] Access URLs:
 --------------------------------------------
    Local: https://localhost:3000
 External: https://{{yourStore}}.vtexlocal.com.br:3000
 --------------------------------------------
```

After you start the terminal it will open a link for you to login with your store credentials and after you have provided your store credentials you can develop everything in this url:

`https://{{yourStore}}.vtexlocal.com.br:3000/`



##Tasks

* JavaScript Module Pattern
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
 

### Exemple 

As we can see the structure of our `src` we have many file entries both JavaScript and Sass.

```sh
├── src
│   ├──assets
│   │       ├──js
│   │       │  └──common
│   │       │         ├──modules
│   │       │         └──test.js
│   │       │
│   │       └──scss
│   │            └──common
│   │                   ├──config
│   │                   ├──layout   
│   │                   └──index.scss   
│   └──views
│         └──template
│               └──Store-Home.html
│               
```

**Build**

```text
dist/
  └──assets 
      ├──js
      │  └──test.js
      └──css    
          └──test.css
```

### Developed with


* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS exoressuvi, dynamic and robust.

* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Robust bundle files.

* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - The Javascript compiler.
 
* [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) - Linter for Javascript code.
