<h2 align="center">Getting Started</h2>

### Requirements 

To get started first you should either clone or download the repository.

You should also have node.js and yarn installed on your computer.

To download the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) just click on the link, usually yarn is installed along with node.js.


### Installing

The first step you must follow to run the project is to install all its dependencies.

The following commands should do this for you.

```
yarn install
```

### Starting with Webpack
```
yarn run dev (development environment)
yarn run build (production environment)  
```

## Usage

### Introduction 

This webpack was basically made to supply the need of multiple entries like Javascript and Sass and generate in separate files.

### BrowserSync
  This webpack has BrowserSync it performs auto reloading after any changes to the file without the need for any software such as `Fiddler` to make this change in the production / development environment. 
 ```js
 new BrowserSyncPlugin({
      open: 'external',
      https: true,
      ui: false,
      host: `${env.STORE_NAME}.vtexlocal.com.br`,
      startpath: '/admin/login/',
      proxy: `https://${env.STORE_NAME}.vtexcommercestable.com.br`,
      serveStatic: [
        {
          route: '/arquivos',
          dir: `${PATHS.dist}/arquivos`,
        },
      ],
    }), 
  ```

  open `package.json` inside him have some config:

  This json is for you to put the name of your store.

  ```json
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "webpack --config ./webpack/webpack.dev.js --watch --mode development --env.STORE_NAME={{ YOUR_STORE_NAME }}",
    }, 
  ```

  This variables is for the current folder where the files are generated by default the webpack is configured to compile everything in /dist;

  ```js
    const PATHS = {
      ....
      common: path.join(__dirname, '../src/common'),
    }
  ```
This variabel is responsible for making the exchange of files from your machine to `https://{{yourstore}}.vtexcommercestable.com.br/arquivos/` from vtex. Remembering that the files must have the same name.

After you have done the basic configuration for BrowserSync to work

**Starting development environment**

  `yarn run dev`

If everything is ok the terminal will show this message:

```js
[Browsersync] Proxying: https://{{yourStore}}.vtexcommercestable.com.br
[Browsersync] Access URLs:
 --------------------------------------------
  Local: https://localhost:3000
  External: https://{{yourStore}}.vtexlocal.com.br:3000
 --------------------------------------------
```

After you start the terminal it will open a link for you to login with your store credentials and after you have provided your store credentials you can develop everything in this url:

`https://{{yourStore}}.vtexlocal.com.br:3000/`
